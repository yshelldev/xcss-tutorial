The Hash Loader operator dynamically imports unique hashes for files, enabling their seamless use as identifiers in HTML attributes, CSS styles, and JavaScript code for efficient tracking and updates.

## Watch Attributes Configuration

Define which HTML attributes should watch for hashes based on file extensions. For example, to watch class and id attributes in HTML files, use this configuration:

```json
"extensions": { "html": [ "class", "id" ] }
```
This setup allows the Hash Loader to recognize and link hashes within those attributes automatically.

## Using Hashes in Watch Attributes

Place hashes directly as values in watched attributes by prefixing them with `#`:

```xml
<section id="#reg-id" class="#reg-class">
```
This links the hash dynamically to the HTML elements for tracking or live updates, enabling reactive styling or scripting tied to these unique identifiers.

### Using Hashes Outside Watch Attributes

When using hashes in other places like JavaScript, CSS, or non-watched attributes, prefix the hash follower with a backslash `\` to escape it, ensuring valid usage without conflicts:

```html
<div onload="func('\#reg-id')">

<style>
  .\#reg-class { ... }  
</style>

<script>
  const id = "\#reg-id";
  const className = "\#reg-class";

  const className = ".\#unreg-class";
  // Note: Unregistered hashes like ".\#unreg-class" will not appear in the rendered output.

  function func(str) {
    // Your function implementation
  }
</script>
```

Using this escaping keeps hashes valid across different contexts whether in HTML, styles, or scripts.

### Additional Tips

- Always escape hashes with `\#` outside watch attribute values.
- Use shortcuts like `Ctrl + Alt + Shift + X` to view the processed output of your source file with hashes applied.

This method ensures consistency and correctness when importing and using unique identifiers across your project files.
