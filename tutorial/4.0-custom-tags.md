# Reserved Custom Tags

XCSS reserves a small set of custom tags and placeholders that make it possible to declare, reuse, and inject styles and snippets directly in markup. These tags are transformed away at compile time, so they never reach the browser.

## Declaration Tags (paired tags)

When a symbolic class (sym-class) appears as an attribute on these special tags, the content between the opening and closing tags is bound to that sym-class. During compilation, the tags themselves are collapsed and only the generated CSS and HTML remain.

```html 
<style local$-class>
  /* CSS snippet bound to local$-class */
</style>

<staple local$--class>
  <!-- Raw snippet bound to local$--class -->
</staple>

<summon
  attribute-1="attr-value-1"
  attribute-2="attr-value-2"
  local$class="
    ~ local$-class local$--class;
    = $class-1 $$class-2 $class-3;
    property-1: value-1;
    property-2: value-2;
    property-3: value-3;
  "
>
  Template
</summon>
```

### `<style> ... </style>`

- Uses the standard HTML `<style>` tag, but when a sym-class is present on the tag, its content becomes a dependent CSS snippet of that sym-class.
- Declared with a sym-class where `-` immediately follows the final `$`, for example: `style$-class-name`.
- The snippet is processed as CSS and merged into the compiled stylesheet.

### `<staple> ... </staple>`

- Binds raw snippets to a sym-class without transforming them.
- Content is imported in minified form but left otherwise unprocessed, making it ideal for SVG defs, filters, or other reusable chunks.
- Declared with a sym-class where `--` immediately follows the final `$`, for example: `staple$--class-name`.

### `<summon> ... </summon>`

- Declares component-level styles and generates a corresponding preview template.
- The attribute value for a sym-class defines its composition and rules.
- The inner HTML is used as a live preview template in the sandbox:
  - Style-related attributes are passed to the sandbox body.
  - Other attributes are passed directly to the preview template.


## Replacement Placeholders

Self-closing tags and reserved HTML comments act as insertion points where compiled styles and staple snippets are injected.

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta
    name="viewport"
    content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"
  />
  <!-- style -->
</head>

<body
  data-sveltekit-preload-data="hover"
  class="=bg$pattern-checkerboard =$custom-pattern"
  _$custom-pattern="
    --pattern-checker-bg1: #456734;
    --pattern-checker-bg2: #2bb43d;
    --pattern-checker-size: var(---delta-block-lg);
  "
>
  <staple amorphous$--container>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      <defs> ... </defs>
    </svg>
  </staple>

  <summon
    data-glass-type="liquid"
    amorphous$$$container="
      ~ amorphous$--container;
      &::after {
        filter: url(#\#glass-distortion);
      }
    "
  >
    Template
  </summon>

  <div
    id="#scoped-id"
    data-glass-type="liquid"
    class="~amorphous$$$container"
  >
    Content
  </div>

  <!-- staple -->
</body>
</html>
```

### `<summon />` / `<!-- summon -->`

- Placeholder used to deploy both the compiled stylesheet and associated staple snippets in one shot.
- Designed for rapid prototyping; for production builds, a more controlled injection strategy is recommended.

### `<style />` / `<!-- style -->`

- Marks where the compiled stylesheet block should be embedded inside targeted files.
- Lets you keep your source clean while still controlling where styles appear in the final HTML.

### `<staple />` / `<!-- staple -->`

- Placeholder for injecting attached staple snippets (for example SVG defs or filters) into the compiled output.
- Ensures shared assets are emitted exactly once in the right place in the document.

These reserved tags and placeholders let XCSS treat HTML as a rich declaration surface for styles, snippets, and components, while compiling everything down to standard HTML and CSS for the browser.
